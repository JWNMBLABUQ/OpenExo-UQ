# OpenExo API/GUI

## Overview
This program can be run via any computer/terminal with python 3.12 installed. Libraries needed can be installed via pip (python's module manager)

Open source API (application programming interface)/ GUI (graphical user interface) writen in Python for controlling the NAU Biomechatronics Lab's OpenExo system.

This project uses the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL v3.0; https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html#header).

The purpose of this project is to provide an open source solution for controlling OpenExo that is accessible to anyone and free to modify for their needs.

## Libraries Needed
BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) is the heart of this project which provides a connection from this API/GUI to the exoskeletons. Bleak, a python library is used to handle all BLE operations. To find out more about Bleak click [here](https://bleak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Operation of the GUI
Please refer to our videos outlining getting started with and operating the GUI [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eBydW7si7EmyGxdDkagQktmnZ7M4nHI4?usp=drive_link).

Before attempting to operate make sure you have both Python and the necessary libraries installed in a known location (we recommend your Documents folder).

For the time being, you will need to use your computer's terminal to get the GUI running, but future iterations will be in the form of an executable file to aid in ease of use.
