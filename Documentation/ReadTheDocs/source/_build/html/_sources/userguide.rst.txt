OpenExo User Guide
================

This file pulls the full user guide directly from the GitHub repository so that
updates remain centralised.

.. note::

   Ensure your *sphinx* configuration allows reading files outside the
   ``docs`` directory (``sphinx.ext.autodoc`` + proper *include* paths), or
   copy the guide into ``docs/`` before building.
