\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Class to blink and LED in a specific pattern to syncronize the data from the microcontroler with optical tracking systems There will be \+\_\+num\+Start\+Stop\+Blinks high pulses at the begining and end of the sequence with each pulse lasting \+\_\+sync\+\_\+start\+\_\+stop\+\_\+half\+\_\+period\+\_\+us. In in between the start and stop it will blink with each high or low lasting \+\_\+sync\+\_\+half\+\_\+period\+\_\+us. The sequence is started and stopped using trigger(). 

This setup requires an external timer since the arduino ISR timers can\textquotesingle{}t take in arguments like the class\textquotesingle{}s self. The to change the LED\textquotesingle{}s actual on/off state, update\+Led must be called. A sample wrapper for the ISR for the timer\+:

void gross\+Led\+Interupt\+Wrapper(void) \{ sync\+Led.\+sync\+Led\+Handler(); // calculate the LED state based on the timer, but don\textquotesingle{}t change the actual LED state. sync\+Timer.\+begin(gross\+Led\+Interupt\+Wrapper, sync\+Led.\+current\+Sync\+Period); // update the timer period ideally we would only do this if it changed, might add a flag to sync\+Led if needed \}

Then in the main loop or when you are recording data\+: int led\+State = sync\+Led.\+update\+Led(); // actually change the led state, and record the state in the data

The static state (not flashing) can be set to either HIGH or LOW

If you need the pin low to be LED on (like with a P channel mosfet) you can change that in the defines below.
